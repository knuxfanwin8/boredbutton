# boredbutton v1.0.2
## The ultimate anti-boredom utility.
![boredbutton](https://awo.oooooooooooooo.ooo/i/zhxt.gif)
## Why would I need it?
You know when you get bored? This button keeps track of how much times you are bored. It also shows you some ideas for things you could do, and you can add your own. (If you made a cool idea, feel free to send it via a GitHub issue.)
## How to install
``USING RELEASES``

1. Grab the newest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/knuxfanwin8/boredbutton/releases). 
2. Unzip the release. 
3. If you haven't set up a local bin folder, do it. (note: Ubuntu does this automatically, you just have to make the ~/bin folder yourself)
4. Open a terminal session in the folder.
5. Run ``./install``.

``BUILD IT YOURSELF``

Pretty much the same but you download/clone the repo instead of getting the release.
## How to use
Run ``bored`` in the terminal. It's that simple!
To access options like the idea creator, counter options (delete, decrease, set) and (soon) package idea lists, run ``bored setup``.
