(or something out of Lego bricks, that will do too!)\ndesc=Maybe you can find the source of your favorite program and try to compile it. Freshest code and fixes guaranteed.\nID3\nname=Try making a funny website!\ndesc=Or a serious website. Either way, try your hand at web design.\nID4\nname=Try flashing a ROM on your old phones.\ndesc=Remember that old phone that has been sitting in your drawer for a few years?
